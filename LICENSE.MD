KVMX is an extension for Kubernetes that enables efficient virtualization management using KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). It provides seamless integration between containerized applications and virtual machines, allowing users to manage both under the same Kubernetes infrastructure. KVMX facilitates the creation, management, and orchestration of VMs directly from Kubernetes, leveraging namespaces for isolation and Kubernetes networking for VM-Pod communication.
